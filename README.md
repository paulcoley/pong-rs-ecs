# pong-rs-ecs

An implementation of Pong in the Rust programming language using a basic entity component system. This was done to gain an understanding of both Rust and ECS systems. It is implemented with Rust-SDL2.

The application can be cloned down and run via cargo run. Choosing new game will pit the player using the W or S key for movement of the left paddle against an AI right paddle. There is no win condition.

Appropriate dlls for sdl2 and sdl2-ttf need to be present for the executable to run.
