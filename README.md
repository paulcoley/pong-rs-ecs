# pong-rs-ecs

An implementation of Pong in the Rust programming language using a basic entity component system. This was done to gain an understanding of both Rust and ECS systems.

The application can be cloned down and run via cargo run. Choosing new game will pit the player using the W or S key for movement of the left paddle against an AI right paddle. There is no win condition.
